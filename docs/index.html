               <h2>On the Subject of Referring to Stell</h2>
               <p class="flavour-text">Words that make the brainy happy :3</p>
               <p>Please use the name <b>Maddy</b> to refer to me. <b>MaddyMoos</b> is alright, but, like, why.</p>
               <p>Please use Stell/Stells pronouns for me (examples below). If you are unable, It/Its is good, and at *worst*, she/her (but I would muchmuch prefer stell).</p>
               <p>I don't like honorifics. Don't use them, please.</p>
               <p>Please call me a void or a cow instead of a girl. You can use compliments such as pretty, cute, or gay for me. I like being called gay. Y'all can call me your friend, bestie, or beloved.</p>
               <p>I'd rather only people who I've established to be my gfs to refer to me as a partner or gf, or calling me hun.</p>
               <p>People in a relationship with me also get access to a secret set of compliments. Obviously not saying them here.</p>
               <br>
               <h3>Example of Stell/Stells</h3>
               <p>
                I think stell is very nice.<br>
                I asked stell if I can borrow stells pencil.<br>
                Stell told me that the house is stells.<br>
                Stell said stell would rather do it stellself. </p>

          <p>Void is my one and only OC, and a character I hold dear to me as a sona.</p>
          <p>I have a lore doc for her <a href="https://maddymoos.github.io/VoidLore/">here.</a> I haven't updated it in a long time and probably should.</p>
          <p>If you do draw her, please keep the following in mind!:</p>
          <ul>
		<!--<li>If you are comfortable with it (warning for udder) I would love if ya drew her as a cow !! therian brain go BRRRRRR. <a href="cowrefs.html">Cow Void reference images!</a></li>
           -->     <li>Please keep Void chubby! It makes me really happy,</li>
                <li>You can make her chubbier, too, if you want.</li>
		<li>I'd prefer if you drew her chubby with a belly instead of just being, wide,,</li>
                <li>Pleasse don't ship her! I consider her as nearly me, thatd be weird to ship me with a random char,</li>
		  <li>Please keep her digitigrade.</li>
                <li>Her hat is wacky and wavy and inflatable tube men. She is a mage, and has purple magic. She would probably cast from her hands.</li>
                <li>Please draw her with the Galaxi flag on her badge as shown in the leftmost art on the refs page or on page 2.</li>
